                    <p class="bodytext"> In economics, it’s common knowledge, for those hoping to predict the next recession, that analysing the Treasury Bond return yield and its trends have a positive correlation towards the inflation rate within the United States. Yet again, why are some of the most experienced financial experts not worried about a recession at all when the general public has been trembling in fear for the last 4 years?

One of the main causes is the rapid polarisation within political ideology in the states. Especially post the 2024 election, this has become significantly amplified as considering the general distain in the public view, exceeding even areas crowded with liberal views.

Yet one of the main sayings that we have to take in to account is that correlation does not equal causation. Though for the 2008 recession and the covid-19 recession, along with the Great Depression all share common intrtistic values of the effects of when there is a recession, this time, there seems to be ana anomaly.

This becomes completely evident when we overlay the unemployment and average salary over the other two factors. During other recessions, these generally went up and down respectively yet this time it’s completely different.

2 factors of which could be the increased government and private investment as seen with companies such as blackrock investing millions into the industry along with increased economic activity. Another, could just be the rampant surge that was seen post covid as well, along with stricter monetary and fiscal policies.

So is a recession coming? Yes. Will it come now? Probably not. The signs are still relevant yet it’s only a matter of time. A long time for that matter and definitely something you don’t have to worry about now.</p>
